It was 12am in the night, I was munching away at a packet of crisps, watching my favourite movie.

Now your probably wondering, who has crisps in the middle of the night while watching a movie, when their parents are probably asleep in the very next room, well, guess what my parents were out for a business trip and would not be returning until the next day, which meant that I had the entire house to myself till tomorrow evening and who would not take advantage of that?

Now, as I was saying - it was around midnight, i was munching away on a packet of crips, watching my all time favourite movie, when a heard the sound of a knock on the door resonate throughout the house, this was weird for me because my parents were surly not home yet.

Now most people would choose to ignore the creepy knock at their door at 12 in the night, but alas me be the thrill loving child i was, had to go to check who exactly was at the door. Since, I was not a complete doofus, i looked through the peephole on the centre of my door before opening it, and what I saw left me quite disturbed, there just outside my door stood a man wearing all black and having a ski mask covering his, making it impossible for me to know who he was - which now looking back on might have his motive the entire time - The man knocked on the door, he seemed to either be getting impatient or excited, i couldn't tell, as this the time the knock was louder.
